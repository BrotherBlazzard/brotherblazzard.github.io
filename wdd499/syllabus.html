            >Senior students will work closely with a professional mentor,
            faculty advisor, and/or peers to develop a project that demonstrates
            the fusion of their undergraduate coursework and experiences. This
            project should allow them to showcase what they have learned, as
            well as learn more about a topic that they would like to master in
            the industry, but did not have the opportunity to do so during their
            core and selected coursework in the degree program.</span

        <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
          <span
            >The purpose of the WDD Senior Capstone is to give students an
            opportunity to choose a significant project to complete that will
            allow them to showcase what they have learned, as well as choose a
            topic that they would like to master but did not have the
            opportunity to do so during their coursework.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
          Through their capstone experience, students will:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Apply what they have learned in the classroom to the
                    creation of a significant web design/development project of
                    their choosing.
                  </li>
                  <li>Learn new skills.</li>
                  <li>
                    Produce a professional quality project that could be used as
                    a portfolio piece.
                  </li>
                </ul>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Course Content: Project</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
          Each student will be required to propose a course project or
          work-based learning experience where direct reporting can be accounted
          for and documented. The project is open ended and student driven. This
          means each student should select a project that allows them to develop
          their skill set in an area of their own choosing ideally preparing
          them for the work force. The goal is to add tools to your working
          resume tool belt which includes a portfolio piece.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
          A final letter grade will be based upon the project selected and
          associated reporting and evaluation.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Project Proposal</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          Getting Started: Your first order of business is to create a proposal
          for your capstone project, paper or campaign. A proposal is like a
          blueprint and provides shape and direction. The more detail you
          include in the proposal the better your finished product. While the
          project type and content will vary between students, there are things
          everyone must address in an effective proposal. Below you will find
          the basic areas you need to cover.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          <strong>Title</strong>: An effective title should help people clearly
          understand the project, its scope and your approach.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          <strong>Summary of your project</strong>: What are you doing? How will
          you do it? If you cannot describe this in a tight, well-written
          paragraph or two you need to rethink the scope of your project. If you
          can describe it in just a few words, you may need to expand your
          vision. If it takes you multiple pages to describe your project it is
          too involved.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          <strong>Justification and Professional Goals</strong>: The capstone is
          not about creating more student work; it is about learning something
          new and creating professional, quality content. You need to justify
          why your project is worthy of your 50 hours and how it will meet your
          professional and academic goals. Recycling an assignment from another
          class is not allowed. This should be uniquely tied to your proposed
          WDD degree. What do you want to do after graduation, and how will this
          capstone help you achieve this goal? You need to show how you are
          pushing your content knowledge and developing new skills.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          <strong>Timetable</strong>: You will need to track all of the time you
          spend for this class. A projected timeline for your project execution,
          production and completion also is important.

            from your originally approved proposal.

        <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Mentor</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          You are required to choose a mentor to work with for your project.
          This can be a professional, co-worker, or a faculty member or
          instructor in a web design/development related field.&nbsp; It is
          preferred that you work with a professional. Your mentor will, in
          conjunction with your instructor, grade the quality and content of
          your capstone project and will need to be aware of aspects of the
          project throughout the process. Your mentor will approve and sign off
          on your project proposal before it goes to the instructor.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          You should turn in your project proposal and signed mentor agreement
          within the first few weeks of the semester. You will be able to submit
          your project proposal online.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          After your proposal is accepted you are required to meet with your
          mentor<span>&nbsp;</span><em>at least</em><span>&nbsp;</span>three
          times during the semester to track your progress. You will discuss
          your work on the project and you should bring samples, drafts, and
          plans for review and to receive feedback and constructive
          criticism.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          When choosing a mentor look for someone who has the knowledge and
          skills to help your accomplish your goals. They should be able to help
          you if you get stuck, and be willing and able to give you good
          detailed feedback to help you do your best work. Take advantage of
          your mentor! Communicate with them regularly, but make sure to respect
          their time. Do your part to make sure you are prepared for each
          meeting.
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Report</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          <span
            >Upon completion, but before presentation you should prepare a
            report detailing what you have learned by completing your project,
            and an accounting of time spent. (This usually takes 1-2
            pages)</span
          >
        </p>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Presentation</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
          At the completion of your project you will need to present it to the
          instructor and/or will be asked to make a digital report version that
          extends the information for placement in a to be determined location
          given the remote status of the campus in Spring 2020.&nbsp;

        <h2>Honor Code</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
          Brigham Young University&ndash;Idaho (BYU-Idaho) and other Church
          Educational System institutions exist to provide an education in an

        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
          BYU-Idaho prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in its
          education programs or activities. Prohibited sex discrimination
          includes incidents of sexual harassment (including sexual violence),
          dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking
          (collectively &ldquo;sexual misconduct&rdquo;).
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
          As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe
          learning environment for my students and for the campus as a whole.
          University policy requires that I report all incidents of sexual
          misconduct that come to my attention. If you encounter sexual
          misconduct, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at
          titleix@byui.edu or 208-496-9200. Additional information about sexual
          misconduct and available resources can be found at<span>&nbsp;</span
