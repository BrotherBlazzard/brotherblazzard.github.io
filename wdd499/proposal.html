      <h2>Spring 2020 ‚Ä¢ Proposal</h2>
      <div class="backButton"><a href="/wdd499/">üè† Home</a></div>
      <p>
        Your capstone web design and development project is self-selected. Your
        proposal must be approved by the instructor and meet the minimum
        expectations of the course in terms of scope, relevance, and timing. You
        will need to work with the instructor to get your project approved. The
        purpose of this deliverable assignment is to formalize your project
        proposal in words.&nbsp;Treat your proposal like a blueprint and
        contract. The more detail you can provide now will help with the scope
        and quality of the final outcome of learning.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        Submit a single page document or page URL that contains, at a minimum,
        this content:
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        <span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Title</strong></span>
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        An effective title should clearly define the project scope.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        <span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Purpose</strong></span>
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        Define the purpose of the project addressing questions about what you
        propose to do and how you will do it. This project purpose description
        should be articulate in a succinct paragraph or two&nbsp; as you
        summarize the intent and scope of the project.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        <span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Justification</strong></span>
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        In a separate section, justify your project proposal by relating it to
        your professional goals. The purpose of the capstone project is to
        provide an opportunity for students to meet the unique challenges of
        this degree program with its high correlation with the industry. Your
        formal degree program provides a foundation upon which you can build and
        expand as you add 'tools to your tool belt'.&nbsp; The purpose of the
        capstone course is for you to selectively strengthen your academic
        experience leading to realistic, industry-based opportunities. Here are
        some things to keep in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: none;">
          <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As much as you can relate this to your future goals and plans
                  the better.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This 2 credit capstone course translates to a minimum of 50
                  hours. Your project must meet that minimum.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Recycling a project from another class is not permitted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enlisting the services of a MENTOR is critical. The mentor may
                  be a faculty member or online instructor, but it is preferred
                  that you work with a professional or related who has ties and
                  insight into the particular area within the industry in which
                  you are interested.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        <span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Timetable</strong></span>
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        <span
          >You will need to track all of the time you spend for this class. A
          projected timeline for your project execution, production and
          completion also is important.</span
