      <h2>Spring 2020 ‚Ä¢ Project Proposal</h2>
      <div class="due">Due: 2 May 2020</div>
      <p>
        Your capstone web design and development project is self-selected. Your
        proposal must be approved by the instructor and meet the minimum
        expectations of the course in terms of scope, relevance, and timing. You
        will need to work with the instructor to get your project approved. The
        purpose of this deliverable assignment is to formalize your project
        proposal in words. Treat your proposal like a blueprint and contract.
        The more detail you can provide now will help with the scope and quality
        of the final outcome of learning.
      </p>
      <h2 class="left">Requirements</h2>
      <p style="padding-left: 20px;">
        Submit a single page document or page URL that contains, at a minimum,
        this content:
      </p>
      <h3 style="padding-left: 20px;">Title</h3>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        An effective title should clearly define the project scope.
      </p>
      <h3 style="padding-left: 20px;">Purpose</h3>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        Define the purpose of the project by addressing questions about what you propose to do and how you will do it. This project purpose description
        should articulate the intent and scope of your project in a succinct paragraph or two.
      </p>
      <h3 style="padding-left: 20px;">Justification</h3>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        Justify your project proposal by relating it to
        your professional goals. Remember, the purpose of the capstone project is to provide an opportunity for students to meet the unique challenges of this degree program with its high correlation with the industry. Your formal degree program provides a foundation upon which you can build and expand upon as you add 'tools to your tool belt'.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">The purpose of the
        capstone course is for you to selectively strengthen your academic experience leading to realistic, industry-based opportunities. Here are
        some things to keep in mind:

      <ul  style="padding-left: 45px;">
        <li>As much as you can relate this to your future goals and plans the better.</li>
                <li>This 2 credit capstone course translates to a minimum of 50 hours. Your project must meet that minimum.
                </li>
                <li>Recycling a project from another class is not permitted.</li>
                <li>Enlisting the services of a MENTOR is required and critical to the success of the project. The mentor may
                  be a faculty member or online instructor or a working or related profession with expertise or invested interest in the particular area within the industry in which you are interested.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 20px;">Timetable</h3>
      <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        You will need to track all of the time you spend for this class. A projected timeline for your project execution, production and completion also is important.</p>
