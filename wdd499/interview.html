    <h2>Spring 2020 ‚Ä¢ Instructor Meeting/Interview</h2>
    <div class="due">Due: 16 July 2020</div>
    <p>
      Each project will be presented to the instructor. This informal meeting involves you
      demonstrating your project scope/progress/results in a shared screen format in my ZOOM office
      (see my signature below for the zoom address).

      I am using calendly for you to pick a 30 minute session.
      If there is an issue with your scheduled time, I will email you directly and we will resolve.

      The goal will to have interviews completed by the 16th of July. You can still work on your
      project and give me an update via email the last day of the term (22nd of July) if needed.

      Here is the link for you to schedule a time: <a
