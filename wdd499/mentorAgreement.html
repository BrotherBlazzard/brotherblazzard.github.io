        <p><strong>The mentor agreement form link will be sent to each student for completion at the beginning of the course.</strong></p>
<p>This form is basically a signed agreement between you, your project mentor, and the instructor. Basic information will be requested and the mentor will be emailed separately, by the instructor, to confirm the agreement.</p>
<h3>Mentor Agreement Description</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">I understand I must complete the Capstone Project Proposal to the satisfaction of my mentor. With his/her assistance, I will outline a project worthy of a working professional.&nbsp;My mentor must be a working professional in the web design or development or highly related field or the mentor can be a faculty member or instructor at BYU-Idaho.&nbsp; Other mentor selections will need to be approved by the instructor. He/she will, in conjunction with my instructor, grade the quality and content of my capstone project and will need to be aware of aspects of the project throughout the process.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">I understand that after my proposal is accepted I am required to meet with my mentor <strong><em><u>at least three</u></em></strong> times during the semester to track my progress. We will discuss my work on the project and I will bring samples, drafts, and plans for review and to receive feedback and constructive criticism.&nbsp; I must meet with my instructor if my project is changed from my originally approved proposal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">I may be asked to present my project in some online venue to be determined, such as the CSE student works conference at the end of the term.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Filling out the form means that you agree to the terms and conditions of WDD 499.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The mentor will then need to agree, via email inquiry by the instructor to work with the student in generating and revising a worthy, professional-level proposal leading to a original, produced portfolio piece for the student.</p>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">To submit this assignment, just provide the date that you submitted the form. The form link will be sent to you or you can request it again from the instructor.</p>
