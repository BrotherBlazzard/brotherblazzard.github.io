  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Review the design documents and conversations from this week's Developer Forum and discussion board.</li>
    <li>Create a new desktop project in Visual Studio.</li>
    <li>Name the project MegaDesk or something similar. We will be building upon this version for next week and the
      week after. You will need to create and maintain this project as a separate repo.</li>
    <li>Build your application framework with default support files and an initial form named Form1.cs.</li>
    <li>Rename Form1.cs to <strong>MainMenu.cs</strong> and build a main menu interface as shown in the <a title="MegaDesk Project Description"
        href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/18600/pages/megadesk-project-description" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/18600/pages/megadesk-project-description"
        data-api-returntype="Page">MegaDesk Project Description.</a></li>
    <li>Add the following objects:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>AddQuote.cs</strong> (Windows Form): This form provides the user input interface.</li>
        <li><strong>DisplayQuote.cs</strong> (Windows Form): This form view displays the current quote information
          after a successful quote add.</li>
        <li><strong>ViewAllQuotes.cs</strong> (Windows Form): This form will display all the quotes by reading from the
          a text file where quotes are stored.</li>
        <li><strong>SearchQuotes.cs</strong> (Windows Form): This user interface form allows the user to pick a
          material type from a combo box and displays all quotes with that material.</li>
        <li><strong>Desk.cs</strong> (Class): This class will define the attributes of the desk object with width,
          depth, number of drawers, and the surface material may contain validation of those attribute values.</li>
        <li><strong>DeskQuote.cs</strong> (Class): This class will define the attributes of a quote including Desk,
          rush days, customer name, and quote date. This class will also hold the logic in determining the line item
          cost.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Create a 3 min (or less) video demonstrating the navigation and validation of the inputs. You do NOT need to
      show code unless there is something specific you want to demonstrate. Narrate your video and demonstrate that
      your application meets the requirements.</li>
    <li>Sync your finished application to a new properly labeled GitHub repository. Make sure it is complete from the
      project root and includes the .sln solution file.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Application Requirements</h2>
  <p style="border:1px solid #E7F4FF;
  background-color:#C9DDFA; margin: 7px; padding: 7px;">You are not completing the entire MegaDesk application this week. Rather, you are just
    getting started by planning and designing the user interface (forms) and setting up the classes with the
    appropriate logic. In this version it is OK to use hard coded 'magic numbers' such as base price, minimum width,
    rush order days, and values for combo boxes, etc. The next version will add additional development specifications
    and requirements to meet the remaining functional specifications from the design.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Your application must have the form navigation completed, allowing the user to navigate from the main menu to
      each form and back again, and the user should be able to exit the application.</li>
    <li>Validate the <strong>width</strong> input with a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.validating?view=netframework-4.7"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Validating event</a>&nbsp;that checks for an integer input and that checks for
      valid minimum and maximum values. The application should provide visual clues for the user to identify where the
      error is located.</li>
    <li>Validate the <strong>height</strong> input using a <em>KeyPress</em> or related event that checks for valid
      integer input using a compound statement and the <em>char</em> data type with IsControl and IsDigit methods.</li>
    <li>Be sure to consider proximity, alignment, contrast, and padding in your input and output interface designs. <a
