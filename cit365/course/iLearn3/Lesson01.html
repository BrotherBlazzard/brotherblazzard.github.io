    <h1>Lesson 01 - Introduction to the Course and C#</h1>
    <h5>Module 1: The C# Language and Visual Studio IDE</h5>
 </div>
<div id="article">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the introductory lesson on ASP.NET programming using C#. We begin this course by laying a foundation of the C# programming language and setting up the development environment. In this lesson we discover the relevancy of the C# language within the development industry, install the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE), and leverage our basic data processing knowledge with the C# programming language. In addition, we will begin to form development teams by introducing ourselves and participating in the weekly, virtual lab class.</p>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop and demonstrate the ability to collaborate in the online learning environment</li>
        <li>Relate the course syllabus and outcomes to the scheduled lessons with the semester time frame</li>
        <li>Setup the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment</li>
        <li>Establish a community of learners with common goals</li>

        <p class="gospel">Teach One Another is a means by which students “step beyond the light they already possess” to contribute to and share responsibility for their learning in a collaborative setting ... when students actively build their own knowledge structures, their ability to retain, apply, and synthesize their learning increases.".<br /><cite><a href="http://www.byui.edu/Documents/instructional_development/overviews/Teach%20One%20Another%20Overview.pdf" target="_blank">BYU-Idaho Learning Model</a></cite>.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this assignment is for you to take the opportunity to teach someone or a small group outside of the class the principles and concepts that you learned to date in this course. The best option is for you to be able to teach the same group each week. Focus on concepts that you can correlate with other coursework within your chosen major and degree plan and/or to practical, work-based experiences. You will spend ~10-15 minutes teaching. You will be asked to report on the individual or group you taught and the concept(s) that you covered. In addition, you will report on any questions or feedback from the individual or group that you taught and reflect on insights that came to you from this teaching opportunity.</p>
