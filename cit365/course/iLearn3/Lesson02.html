<h1>Lesson 02 - Using C# and Visual Studio</h1>
<h5>Module 1: The C# Language and Visual Studio IDE</h5>
</div>
<div id="article">
<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In this lesson we discover the relevancy of the C# language within the development industry, use the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) to build a simple windows application, and leverage our basic data processing knowledge with the C# programming language. We will investigate C# features, syntax, variables, identifiers, data types, operators, decision blocks, loops, and general program flow. By the end of the lesson you will be able to converse with others about these concepts and be able to explain a simple console application written in C#.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Leverage and apply fundamental programming concepts and structures in the C# language</li>
        <li>Use the Visual Studio integrated development environment at the basic, operational level</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Activities</h2>
