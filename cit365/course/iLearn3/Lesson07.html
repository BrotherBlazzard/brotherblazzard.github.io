<h1>Lesson 07 - Working with Database Data</h1>
<h5>Module 2: ASP.NET Web Pages with Razor</h5>
</div>
<div id="article">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We continue our work with ASP.NET Web Pages by working with data which is the foundation of most web applications and the dynamic nature of the content of those sites. During this lesson we review the basic structure of databases, build a database using SQL Server Compact Edition, and build an application that views, adds, edits, and deletes records through a form interface. The lesson is built around an online tutorial that provides an overview of all of these common data activities and includes work on connectivity, validation, rich controls (helpers), and data manipulation through SQL commands.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Leverage database knowledge in the ASP.NET Web Pages environment</li>
            <li>Run SQL commands in ASP.NET Web Pages</li>
            <li>Display, add, update, and delete data from a database</li>
            <li>Customize controls and helpers to leverage development cycles</li>
        </ul>

                        <p>The developer forum discussion board provides an opportunity for students to asynchronously post questions and answers related to lesson concepts and activities. Participation is required and is typically specified as part of the individual programming exercises and team development projects. The postings are monitored and supported by the instructor each day.</p>

                        Using the concepts presented from the tutorial in the required readings, finalize the build of your <strong>My Scripture Journal</strong> ASP.NET Web Pages application by providing capabilities of standard database operations. These include the ability to add new scriptures, edit exisiting scripture records, delete scriptures from the list, search by book or keyword in the notes field, and, of course, view the favorite scriptures list. The list should be sortable by book and date added. In addition, use pagination with the list showing a maximum of five (5) scripture records at a time.</p>

Focus on concepts that you can correlate with other coursework within your chosen major and degree plan or to practical, work-based experiences. You will spend ~10-15 minutes teaching. You will be asked to report on the individual or group you taught, the length of time, and the concept(s) that you covered. In addition, you will report on any questions or feedback from the individual or group that you taught and reflect on insights that came to you from this teaching opportunity.</p>
