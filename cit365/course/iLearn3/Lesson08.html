</div>
    <div id="article">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this lesson we continue to learn the ASP.NET Web Pages framework by working on user interaction through form processing, form validation, multimedia, and overall user experience concepts. In addition, we investigate a handful of the available helpers in ASP.NET. which are built-in or custom-made components that help simplify common web programming tasks such as the WebGrid for data display and the Chart Helper for charting images. The programming exercise in this lesson focuses on the module's team project which is due at the end of the next lesson.</p>
