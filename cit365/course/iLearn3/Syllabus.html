<p>This course attempts to balance the concepts of hands-on training with professional, academic education, both of which are essential parts of lifelong learning and success in the industry.</p>
<h3>Course Theme</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bc/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1/images/074-074-king-benjamin-addresses-his-people-full.jpg?download=true" alt="King Benjamin in Mosiah 4" title="King Benjamin" width="291" height="213" class="right" />In Mosiah 4 King Benjamin counsels us to &ldquo;impart of our substance to others and do all things in wisdom and order&rdquo;. At BYU-Idaho we follow a structured learning model of preparing, teaching one another, pondering, and proving. As such, our course theme is based upon <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng" target="_blank">Mosiah 4: 15</a> &ldquo;But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.&rdquo; and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng" target="_blank">Mosiah 4:27</a> &ldquo;And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Prerequisite Knowledge</h2>
<p>In order to successfully begin and progress through this course, a student will need to have a solid foundation in programming logic and design, objected oriented principles, basic database concepts, and in the core web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, students will need to be comfortable installing and troubleshooting software programs on their chosen platform.</p>

<h3>Assessed Activities</h3>
<h4>Professionalism</h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Virtual Lab Attendance and Reflection</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The live, virtual lab class is an opportunity for students to interact with their peers and with the instructor to discuss lesson concepts and related, contemporary topics in the field. The lesson's content will be the catalyst for this recorded conversation. Attendance and a report of reflection is required for each virtual lab class that is held. Given that some students will not be able to meet at the designated time, the class will be recorded. Students may elect to attend this required virtual lab live or watch the recording. A keyword will be given during the class for reporting purposes and students will submit some reflective thought(s) about the conversation.</p>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Developers Forum Participation</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Each lesson provides an opportunity for students to asynchronously post questions and answers to a discussion board about lesson concepts and activities . Participation is required and supported by the instructor.</p>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Instructor Interaction</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The instructor will evaluate student interactions and professionalism throughout the course from postings, emails, conversations, and participation. The concept is that the instructor has a development manager role in the course and as part of the student performance evaluation, he/she will assess a student's professional soft-skills in areas such as listening, adaptability, teamwork, attitude, work ethic, professional reasoning, and ego management.</p>
<h4>Concept Fluency</h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Quizzes</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The purpose of quizzes is to assess student comprehension and fluency with the assigned subject matter presented in the required readings and materials. The quiz is open text and internet, however, the quiz is timed for a balanced assessment whereas students know the concept and just need to quickly review some details to answer the question properly.</p>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Instructor Interviews</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The instructor will conduct two (2) one-on-one interviews with each student during the course. The purpose of these interviews is to get to know each student at a conversational level and assess concept fluency. This will not be a quiz of knowledge but rather a conversation about current activity and concepts from the course. These interviews will also be an opportunity to demonstrate professionalism and provide feedback.</p>
<h4>Application Exercises</h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Programming Activities </h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">These development exercises are learning activities where students are given well-defined programming problems. Typically these exercises will be completed on an individual basis, however, peer review and participation in the developers forum will be complementary, assessed elements of these activities.</p>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Peer Review</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Programming activities are often associated with peer review discussion boards. The purpose of these peer reviews is to provide opportunities for students to collaborate and teach. As students ponder application solutions to the assigned exercises, the peer review provides a formalized review of design documents and of other development modules.</p>
<h4>Team Projects</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Students will be paired to another student in the class in order to complete more involved applications. Teams will collaborate and work together to create one solution to submit for final evaluation for each assigned project.</p>
<h4>Teaching Journal</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The purpose of teaching outside of the class and reflecting upon that teaching is based upon the principle of learning and retention by teaching. Students will briefly teach concepts and principles from the lesson to an individual or small group and report on questions or insights that have arisen by taking this opportunity which often happens naturally as students apply what they are learning to the world around them.</p>

<h2>Disclaimers | Procedures | Policies</h2>
<h3>Learning and Paired Programming</h3>
<p>The best way to learn is through experience and the second best way to learn is to teach. A critical element of the BYU-Idaho learning model is to teach and learn from one another and that skill-set is translated directly into the industry/work force. Developer collaboration using online tools and social media is an essential element of student development as a professional. During this course, students will be paired with a team member or members where consistent communication will be required. Each programming assignment has specific instructions on whether the project will be completed individually or as an assigned team. Regardless, the lesson's Q&amp;A board will be used for teaching, reflection, and peer reviews.</p>
<h3>Late Work</h3>
<p>Late work will not be accepted unless a student has extenuating circumstances such as a hampering illness. Chronic situations will be assessed on an individual basis. Please contact the instructor via email as soon as possible before a deliverable is due. Students are responsible to seek means to get caught up in work that are not outside the scope of the learning management system. In addition, students will need to be very conscientious towards fellow team members in this class as to not exact an unnecessary burden upon them.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="warning">The instructor reserves the right to change any part of this syllabus at any time during the semester in order to adapt to changing course needs. Students will be notified prior to any changes that may take place.</p>
