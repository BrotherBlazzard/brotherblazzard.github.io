<h2>Assessed Activities</h2>
<h4>Professionalism 20% </h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Virtual Lab Attendance and Reflection (12 @ 4 points each 
= 48 total)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The live, virtual lab class is an opportunity for students to interact with their peers and with the instructor to discuss lesson concepts and related, contemporary topics in the field. The lesson's content will be the catalyst for this recorded conversation. Attendance and a report of reflection is required for each virtual lab class that is held. Given that some students will not be able to meet at the designated time, the class will be recorded. Students may elect to attend this required virtual lab live or watch the recording. A keyword will be given during the class for reporting purposes and students will submit some reflective thought(s) about the conversation.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0-4</td>
    <td>Graded as a quiz requiring occasional review by instructor on the reflective question to assess accurate participation by the student; participation recorded (1); correct keyword given(1); reflection was on point and reference relevant discussion points made during the virtual lab (2).</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Developer Forum Participation (12 @ 3 points each)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Each lesson provides an opportunity for students to asynchronously post questions and answers to a discussion board about lesson concepts and activities. Participation is required and supported by the instructor.</p>

    <td>Original post or reply was on topic, original, relevant and contributed to the quality of the discussion. Responses are clearly written and used supportive, positive language. The appropriate number of postings has been made. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Generally a reduction of one point is based upon the quality of the original posts or reply. The response is still well written and supportive but may lack relevant substance or did not add to the quality of the discussion.</td>

    <td>Original posts and replies are on topic, but lack originality, and/or lacked a significant contribution to the quality and required quantity of the discussion.</td>

    <td>0</td>
    <td>No successful posting was made or the posting was completely off topic and/or not original.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Instructor Interaction (3 @ 10 points each)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The instructor will evaluate student interactions and professionalism throughout the course from postings, emails, conversations, interviews and participation. The concept is that the instructor has a development manager role in the course and as part of the student performance evaluation, he/she will assess a student's, professional, soft-skills. </p>

  <tr>
    <td>0-10</td>
    <td>Professional soft-skills based upon the above named interactions will include listening, adaptability, teamwork, attitude, work ethic, professional reasoning, and ego management. A student will receive an evaluation during lesson 5, lesson 10, and at the end of the course.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
<h4>Concept Fluency (20%)</h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Quizzes (10 @ 5-15 points each)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The purpose of quizzes is to assess student comprehension and fluency with the assigned subject matter presented in the required readings and materials. The quiz is open text and internet, however, the quiz is timed for a balanced assessment whereas students know the concept and just need to quickly review some details to answer the question properly.</p>

    <th>Assessment Criteria</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5-15</td>
    <td>The system will automatically assign points for each question. The quizzes are timed but are open, non-human resource. The instructor will review quiz solutions and grading for accuracy as needed.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Instructor Interviews ( 2 @ 100 points each)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The instructor will conduct two (2) one-on-one interviews with each student during the course. The purpose of these interviews is to get to know each student at a conversational level and assess concept fluency. This will not necessarily be a quiz of knowledge but rather a conversation about current activity and concepts from the course. These interviews will also be an opportunity to demonstrate professionalism and provide feedback.</p>

    <td>0-100</td>
    <td>The instructor will assess the student's activity in the course as it relates to the exercises and projects looking for understanding and correct 
	thought on application and relationship. The interview will include questions and discussion about extra-curricular discover and activity.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

<h4>Application Exercises (20%)</h4>
<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Programming Activities (10 @ 20 points each)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">These development exercises are learning activities where students are given well-defined programming problems. Typically these exercises will be completed on an individual basis, however, peer review and participation in the developers forum will be complementary, assessed elements of these activities.</p>
<table class='rubric' style="margin: 10px auto; width:70%;">
  <tr>
    <th>Points</th>
    <th>Assessment Criteria</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>13-20</td>
    <td>Exercise is complete and meets most to all of the requirements in terms of functional specifications and program operation. Reductions from full 
	credit are based upon missing components, logic errors, presentation faults, and/or grammar.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6-12</td>
    <td>The submitted solution runs but does not produce required output; there are major logic and run-time errors of 'complete' exercises and required 
	components are missing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1-5</td>
    <td>The submitted solution does not run; submission consists of only design documents, text, basic, template structures with minor student development.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>No submission</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

<h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Peer Review (4 @ 10 points each)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Programming activities are often associated with peer review discussion boards. The purpose of these peer reviews is to provide opportunities for students to collaborate and teach. As students ponder application solutions to the assigned exercises, the peer review provides a formalized review of design documents and of other development modules.</p>

    <td>No participation</td>

<h4>Team Projects (30%) (3 @ 100 points each)</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Students will be paired to another student in the class in order to complete more involved applications. Teams will collaborate and work together to create one solution to submit for final evaluation for each assigned project.</p>

    <td>0-100</td>
    <td>The instructor will assess the team's working applications for 
	conformance to functional and program specifications as outlined in each 
	project description. The points allocated will be based upon a standard 
	scale working from 90 points with partial credit being applied going down 
	from inaccurate or missing functionality, presentation, and/or features. </td>
  </tr>
  </table>

<h4>Teaching Reflection Journal (10%) (12 @ 3 points each)</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The purpose of teaching outside of the class and reflecting upon that teaching is based upon the principle of learning and retention by teaching. Students will briefly teach concepts and principles from the lesson to an individual or small group and report on questions or insights that have arisen by taking this opportunity which often happens naturally as students apply what they are learning to the world around them.</p>
