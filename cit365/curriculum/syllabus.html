    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This course leverages a student's background and experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and fundamental, object-oriented programming with the Visual Studio IDE running the .NET framework using the C# programming language. During the course, students will build upon a C# foundation using the .NET framework to design and develop scalable, standards-based web sites, applications, and services using contemporary methodologies and established design patterns. Teamwork and programming deliverables will be required.</p>
    <h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
    <p>Students will participate in regular learning patterns within each lesson. Students will prepare by completing the assigned readings and online activities. Students will teach one another by participating in peer reviews of code, developer discussion boards, and working in programming teams. Students will ponder by applying and correlating the principles to their discipline and work-based learning opportunities. Students will prove competency by completing knowledge assessments and programming projects: some with well-defined functional specifications and others with less definition.</p>
    <p>This course attempts to balance the concepts of hands-on training with professional, academic education, both of which are essential parts of lifelong learning and success in the industry.</p>
    <h3>Course Theme</h3>
    <p><img style="float: right;" src="/courses/18600/files/2247202/preview" alt="King Benjamin" width="231" height="169" /></p>
    <p>In Mosiah 4, King Benjamin counsels us to impart of our substance to others and do all things in wisdom and order. At BYU-Idaho we follow a structured learning model of preparing, teaching one another, pondering, and proving. As such, our course theme is based upon <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mosiah 4:15</a>, &ldquo;but ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another&rdquo; and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mosiah 4:27</a>, &ldquo;and see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.&rdquo;</p>
    <h2>Prerequisite Knowledge</h2>
    <p>In order to successfully begin and progress through this course, a student will need to have a solid foundation in programming logic and design, objected-oriented principles, basic database concepts, and in the core web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, students will need to be comfortable installing and troubleshooting software programs on their chosen platform.</p>
    <h2>Required Materials</h2>
    <p><em><strong>C# Programming Yellow Book</strong> </em>by Rob Miles: <a href="http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free PDF Version</a></p>
    <p><strong>Visual Studio Community: </strong>This free, integrated development environment by Microsoft is required to complete the exercise and project assignments. Student systems must be capable of meeting the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/productinfo/vs2017-system-requirements-vs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimum system requirements</a>. In summary, Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for creating applications for Windows, Android, and iOS, and for building contemporary web applications and cloud services. ASP.NET is the free web framework for developing web sites, mobile sites, web APIs, and web applications using a foundation of core technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    <div class="callout right full blue">
    <p>OS X users may elect to not use the Visual Studio for Mac version and would need to install and run Visual Studio Community in Windows using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boot Camp</a>, VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, or Parallels Desktop installation on your Mac. Microsoft Windows is free through the department-provided Microsoft On The Hub student account.</p>

    <h3>Teaching Journal (10%)</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The purpose of teaching outside of the class and reflecting upon that teaching is based upon the principle of learning and retention by teaching. Students will briefly teach concepts and principles from the lesson to an individual or small group and report on questions or insights that have arisen by taking this opportunity. This often happens naturally as students apply what they are learning to the world around them.</p>

    <h4>Focused Discussions - measured across multiple areas</h4>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The purpose of these focused discussions is to provide opportunities for students to collaborate, teach, and relate the content of the course to the real world. One type of focused discussion is the peer review where students ponder application solutions to the assigned exercises and receive a formalized review of design documents and ideas. Other discussions are based upon contemporary development approaches and industry trends.</p>

    <h3>Learning and Paired Programming</h3>
    <p>The best way to learn is through experience and the second-best way to learn is to teach. A critical element of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model is to teach and learn from one another and that skill set is translated directly into the industry/work force. Developer collaboration using online tools and social media is an essential element of student development as a professional. During this course, students will be paired with a group of team members where consistent communication will be required.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Late Work</h3>
    <p>Late work will not be accepted unless a student has extenuating circumstances such as a hampering illness. Chronic situations will be assessed on an individual basis. Please contact the instructor via email as soon as possible before a deliverable is due. Students are responsible to seek means to get caught up in work that is not outside the scope of the learning management system. In addition, students will need to be very conscientious towards fellow team members in this class as to not exact an unnecessary burden upon them.</p>
