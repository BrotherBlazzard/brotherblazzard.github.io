# Front-End Development Standards

The development standards ensure that we are meeting a minimum technical specification threshold in a formal course and are used as a baseline in the feedback loop and assessment of submitted work by the student.

The following list is influenced by ðŸ“ƒ[The Front-End Checklist](https://frontendchecklist.io/) by David Dias.

The references are to [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) sources. MDN is the official reference used in this course for HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Overall

- All folders and files follow [the course file and folder naming rules](fileandfoldernamingrules.md 'File and Folder Naming Rules') which include lowercase only, no spaces, and are friendly/semantic.
- No relevant violations of **design principles** of [alignment, proximity, contrast, repetition](https://byui.instructure.com/courses/10157/pages/w02-activity-design-principles 'W02 Activity: Design Principles'), and usable typography.
- The visual appearance of all pages in the site must be **responsive**, uniform, and consistent at three, basic view levels.
