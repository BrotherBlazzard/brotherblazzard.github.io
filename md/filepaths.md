### **Troubleshooting File Paths**

Whenever an image does not show up or a JavaScript file fails to run, first 1) check the file name, and then 2) check the file path. The reference must be accurate. Also, make sure the file actually exists. Maybe you did not get it pushed up as part of your repository. You must understand relative file paths versus absolute file paths (the reference (href or src) starts with a protocol, e.g., https:// ). You must understand the relationship of where the file is that is referencing the image or resource compared it actually is located.
