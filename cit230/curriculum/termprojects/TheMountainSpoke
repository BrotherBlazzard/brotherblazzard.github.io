<h1>Term Website Project: The Mountain Spoke</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Term Website Project is designed to be a&nbsp;comprehensive assessment of all the course objectives. You will be given exact specifications as if you were contracted to plan, design, and build a prototype website for an organization.

This independent, term project will be of your own design and work, you may not consult or work with any other individual or group. The content is fictitious, but the site should be complete without any placeholders or nonsense language. Create a working site containing relevant and reasonable information. The images and brief verbiage may be referenced from other sources which will need to be cited in a resource reference page, which link will be located in the footer.</p>
