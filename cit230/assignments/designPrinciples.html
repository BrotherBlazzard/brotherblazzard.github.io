            <h1>Design Principles Presentation</h1>
            <hr />
            <div>
                <div class="callout"><strong>Note</strong>: Earlier in the week, you were charged to spend <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=212799&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-415377" target="_self">24 hours using only a mobile browser</a> for casual Internet use. You were also to have completed the viewing of the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=212799&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-528330" target="_self">Principles of Design video course.</a> Now that these two activities are complete you are assigned the following task:</div>
                <p>This &nbsp;document will be created through a joint effort in your assigned group. Use the Group Discussion board to communicate and organize your team members around this object. This assessed activity is not due until the middle of the next lesson but you should start communicating right away.</p>
                <p>Each member of your group is responsible for one or more design principles to contribute towards this document (depending on team size). <span>Each team member is responsible to find and capture a screen shot of a mobile web page</span> (<em><span>this must be in a browser, not a mobile app</span></em>) <span>that illustrates the assigned principle and writing copy that explains why and how</span> the page illustrates the specific design principle.</p>
                <p>Once the content has been developed, the image and paragraph&nbsp;will be sent to the team lead who will build a PDF file that will consist of five sections (each representing one of the design principles covered in this lesson):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                    <li>Repetition</li>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                    <li>Typography</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Each section will consist of four&nbsp;elements:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clearly stated heading of the design principle.</li>
                    <li>The name of the team member responsible for each section should be part of the section heading.</li>
                    <li>Screen shot of the mobile web page being discussed.</li>
                    <li>The name of the website used in the picture</li>
                    <li>A brief explanation of how the design principle is exemplified in the screen shot.&nbsp;</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Template</h2>
                <p>The <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=212799&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-683686" target="_self">Design Template</a>&nbsp;page is&nbsp;for the team lead to use as a template to create the document. The file should be downloaded and unzipped or copied and pasted. The finished file should be renamed to represent the design principles assessment. When renaming the template, <a href="https://blainerobertson.github.io/230d2l/resources/naming.html" target="_blank" title="Review the web naming rules">follow the web naming rules</a>&nbsp;from last week's materials. Save the file to a folder that will be used for storing homework in your website.</p>
                <h2>Submitting Your Group's Work</h2>
                Once the page is constructed, the team lead will post the page to her or his site as a PDF and send the page URL to each team member. <strong>All team members will post the link to the PDF document of the team lead from their own site.</strong>
